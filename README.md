üíª #Operating System Lab Practicals
This repository contains C programs and shell scripts developed as part of the Operating System Lab (Course Code: T7511) during my coursework in the Computer Science and Engineering program.

üìö ##Course Overview
The Operating System lab focused on practical implementation of OS concepts using C programming and Linux shell scripting. The main goals included understanding process scheduling, memory management, file operations, and command-line utilities in a Linux environment.
